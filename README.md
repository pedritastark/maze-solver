# maze-solver
Python project developed using graph theory to address problems that can be formulated using graphs. Specifically, this repository is dedicated to addressing an NxM labyrinth. The approach chosen to solve it is the implementation of traversal and search algorithms in graphs. The context of this project dates back to one of my first attempts with Python during my university studies, completed as part of "Graph Theory".

# Summary 
The problem can be defined as an NxM labyrinth on which the graph associated with that labyrinth will be built and thus, through re-travel and search algorithms such as BFS, DFS, a solution will be found.

# Visualization 

An important part of the project is the visualization. When we use any of the algorithms developed to solve it, you can see the step by step of the algorithm until we find a solution.

# Aprecciation

This project exists thanks to the hard work of the School of Engineering, Science, and Technology under the leadership of Daniel Alfonso Bojac√° Torres, a professor at the University of Rosario.
